This is a fork of John Winans' [Verilog-Examples](https://github.com/johnwinans/Verilog-Examples). I used it mainfy for the build system he provides, which I found well-suited for my need as a beginner in FPGA design to learn and control the process, and I chose it over [apio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio).  
Under [barak-making-use-of-build-system](https://github.com/barakbarlevi/Verilog-Examples/tree/main/barak-making-use-of-build-system) you'll find the Verilog code that I used in my [documented work](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1myHPIgDS3YTJ36jgYJsa536rMOdVYWa2/view?usp=drive_link), where I provide an introduction to FPGA design and a walkthrough of several exercises. This code is heavily based on Shawn Hymel's [introduction-to-fpga](https://github.com/ShawnHymel/introduction-to-fpga).
