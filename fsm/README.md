# Introduction to Verilog Finite State Machines

- fsm0: A Moore FSM built using one always block.
- fsm1: A Moore FSM built using two always blocks.
- fsm2: A Moore 2-bit synch counter counter with enable and synch reset.
- fsm3: A Moore serial bit-stream recognizer with synch reset.
- fsm4: A Mealy serial bit-stream recognizer with synch reset.

Some of these examples are based on course notes and handouts that can
